# lazlonger

Chrome extension that persists your lazada web session a little longer :)

### Why?

Lazada does not persist log in credentials which sucks for lazy people like me.

### Usage

You don't need to do anything special, just log in to lazada and your session will be persisted long after you've exited the browser.

**NOTICE** // If you want to use this:

- This extension basically just adds a 30-day expiration on session cookies
- This extension is untested
- The logo is pretty cool though
